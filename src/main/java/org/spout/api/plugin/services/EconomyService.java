/**
 * The economy service is a basic service that can be extended and registered as a service provider.
 * To implement your own economy, create a new class which extends EconomyService and overrides
 * the abstract methods.
 * To register your EconomyService you will need to do something similar to:
 * <code>getServiceManager().register(EconomyService.class, myEconomyInstance, myPlugin, ServicePriority)</code>
 * 
 * For plugins that wish to get the current economy provider, they will need to:
 * {@link EconomyService#getEconomy()}</code> this method can possibly return null, if an economy service
 * has not been registered yet with the ServiceManager.  
 * 
 * Another option is to hook the {@link ServiceRegisterEvent}
